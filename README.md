## Demo overview
This app allows the user to order baked goods, available in desktop and mobile versions. 
The user adds the desired products to the order, where the total cost is calculated. 
The user is then taken to the payment modal and receives a personalised order confirmation.

Possible actions:
- Adding individual products to the order
- Removing products from the order
- Proceeding with the payment
- Receiving a personalised order confirmation

## Developer overview
This is a simple app I built to reinforce my JavaScript learning. 
- This app contains a data file, housing an object for each item available for sale
- The items for sale displayed on the screen are rendered in JavaScript, by mapping over the array of objects and generating the HTML
- This app features a functionality to add or remove items in the order, updating the total price as the number of items in the basket increase or decrease
- Conditional rendering is used to display the order summary
- The payment form is displayed in a modal with the order confirmation referencing the client's name to confirm the order
